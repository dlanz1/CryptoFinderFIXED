**Project Description**
This web application is CryptoFinder, for Project #2 in our Web App Development
course with Prof. Toal. This assignment is to show our understanding of React while
also demonstrating our ability to implement APIs.

**Application Description**
This application uses an API containing data of cryptocurrency. The application
uses this API by taking a text entry, in which it will return data about the 
inputted cryptocurrency given it is spelt correctly or its symbol is submitted, i.e.
if "bitcoin" or "BTC" is submitted it will show data such as its name, symbol,
price, and market cap.
