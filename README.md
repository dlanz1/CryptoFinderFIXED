**Project Description**
This web application is a crypto finder, for Project#2 in our Web App Development
class with DR Toal. This assignment is to show our understanding of React while
also showing that we are able to implement APIs.

**Application Description**
This application uses an API containing data of Crypto Currency. The application
uses this API by taking a text entry, in which it will return data about the 
inputed crypto given it is spelt correctly or its symbol is submitted, i.e.
if "bitcoin" or "BTC" is submitted it will show data such as its name, symbol,
price, and marketcap. On the other hand, if "bticoin" is submitted, it will not
return anything
